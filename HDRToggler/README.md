# HDRToggler

**AutoHotkey v2 script that toggles HDR in Windows 10 using [HDRSwitch by cocafe](https://github.com/cocafe/HDRSwitch)**

### üåü Features

- Detects current HDR state on launch
- Toggles HDR on/off via tray click, tray menu, or hotkey (Ctrl + Alt + H)
- Dynamic tray icon updates based on HDR status
- Comes with a precompiled `HDRToggler.exe` for users who don‚Äôt want to install AutoHotkey
- Comes with a precompiled `HDRSwitch.exe` for thos who can't or won't compile C, C++

### üì¶ Requirements

- Windows 10 (Windows 11 users have other options built into the OS and on GitHub)
- [`HDRSwitch.exe`](https://github.com/cocafe/HDRSwitch/releases) (precompiled `.exe` included here for convenience)
- HDR-capable monitor (not really required to run but you'll just be toggling hot air otherwise)

### üîß Installation

1. Download this repo and place `HDRSwitch.exe` in the same folder.
2. Run either:
   - `HDRToggler.ahk` (if you have AutoHotkey v2 installed)
   - `HDRToggler.exe` (if you don‚Äôt want AutoHotkey ‚Äî it‚Äôs precompiled for convenience)
4. Use **Ctrl + Alt + H**, left-click the tray icon, or use right-click tray menu to toggle HDR.
5. Create shortcut and place in startup folder to run on windows boot.

## Notes

- This script creates a small 1KB file [`hdrlog.txt`] to read monitor status which is overwritten with each toggle (no bloat).
- This script expects that Monitor 0 (based on output from "HDRSwitch.exe --list") is your HDR capable monitor.  Check `hdrlog.txt` and modify script accordingly
